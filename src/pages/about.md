# About

"Spot The Hoax" is a fun little university project created by two students, designed to educate about the potential exposure to fake news on social media platforms.

It's meant to create a familiar feeling by recreating an Instagram-like artificial feed that includes real and fake news posts. The fake news stories are all created by [ChatGPT 4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o) to demonstrate the ease of fabricating and spreading misinformation online. The real news stories were collected from various trusted news sites in Germany and Austria.

The imagery used for the posts are either sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), or generated by [DALL-E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#dall-e).

This project is completely open source. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/vascYT/spot-the-hoax).
